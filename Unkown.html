                <b>I designed an escape game with the theme of human trafficking in China. At the end of the last century, the problem of human trafficking was serious, not only in terms of law and order, but also in terms of economic and gender imbalance. I want to show the cruelty and persecution of people and families behind this phenomenon, mixed with the persecution of women in economically backward areas due to gender inequality. Various events mentioned in the game are prototyped as news cases.
My first thought was to write about the theme of human trafficking, and then I chose the grandchildren of trafficked persons as the entry point to experience the grandmother's tragic life. Using the technique of flashbacks, a person close to her finally understands her at the end of her life, and at the same time reveals the irreversible facts of her life. The game is played on a point system, with different values determining the end of the game. The game also shows the cruelty of the reality of the fate that is hard to escape. I also added some random numbers to the game to show the unpredictability of fate and the powerlessness of not being able to control it.
After using the hypertext narrative method it is possible for my game to break the linear narrative and reach multiple endings. Also variables and random numbers can only be realized through hypertext. The more difficult part is that I need to manage multiple story lines, and if one needs to be modified I need to be careful that the other main lines are coherent and logical. The organization of the story also needs to be pre-designed or it will get disorganized.
