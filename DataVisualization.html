        <b>In my data analysis project, I first used area plots to show the change in headcount share by year for different salary levels in UK academia as the most visual total distribution to introduce to the data analysis. I then used a time-series dynamic scatterplot to show the growth in headcount and salary as the year progressed. I believe that the presence of a dynamic table at the front helps to attract attention and the dynamic changes give a more subjective view of the trend of the data changes. Next, I cut to 2022, the most recent year in the year, and used a bar graph to display one year's worth of data in the most visual and concise way, highlighting the differences. On the next page, I chose a radial tree chart, which is able to show a global view of how different disciplines are represented in different salary levels and highlights the hierarchy. The subsequent page continues the perspective from the disciplines by using a circular chart with a time slider to focus on the discipline share relationships and dynamics. After that, I chose to use a circular wrapper chart to visually compare the share of each age group in different wage levels, a hierarchical treatment that facilitates the audience's layered understanding. The last side continues with a bar chart to show the percentage of gender in different wage levels, which allows for a strong comparison since there are only a few subgroups.
Regarding improvements, I believe that I need to refer to more data such as the average wage in each wage band and changes over time and other factors within a particular wage band, and I also need to add design clarity and more coherent thinking.
