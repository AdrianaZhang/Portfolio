            Newcastle being an old city, historical buildings are not easily demolished.<br/>
            We can see the history of Newcastle as a city from their functional transformation.<br/>
            As Sharon Zukin analyzed the formation and evolution of urban cultural landscapes in <br/>
            The Cultures of Cities. Functional transformations of historic buildings during Newcastle's<br/>
            urban transformation are not only a sign of the city's development, but also an important part <br/>
            of the city's cultural landscape. By reusing historic buildings and spaces, the city has created <br/>
            a new cultural landscape, attracted more cultural and creative industries to develop, and <br/>
            contributed to the city's economic prosperity.<br/>
            Mapping can help show the spatial relationships and geographic locations of these changes.<br/> 
            By labeling these locations with historical information and current uses, the evolutionary process <br/>
            and trajectory of the city can be presented. I used an ancient theme as the base map for this <br/>
            sidebar map to represent the historical development. I have chosen to use buildings from different <br/>
            time periods with different functions to tell the story of Newcastle's history, culture and <br/>
            significance as a city. I have also used images from different periods to compare and contrast to <br/>
            show the changes in function. The different geographical locations also show the reasons for the <br/>
            different functions of the buildings, such as the Chamber of Commerce and Customs being on the <br/>
            river and the factories being further away. As a whole, this is the transformation of Newcastle <br/>
            from a maritime commercial center to an industrial base to a city with a humanistic culture at <br/>
            its core.<br/>
            Behind the transformation of the city we can see the shift to cultural industries after the <br/>
            exhaustion period of the old city's development, and the driving force behind the transformation <br/>
            of the city is precisely the social and cultural changes (Jane Jacobs). The theory of gentrification <br/>
            mentioned by Neil Smith in The New Urban Frontier: Gentrification and the Revanchist City makes it <br/>
            easy to see that the center of Newcastle today consists of a wide range of cultural venues and high <br/>
            end restaurants, behind which is the pressure of rising rents and increased costs of living, which <br/>
            attracts a large amount of population movement by changing the surrounding community landscape, with <br/>
            wealthy residents and businesses moving in and former residents moving out to a more urbanized area. <br/>
            Wealthy residents and businesses move in, and former residents move to more distant neighborhoods. The <br/>
            city's efforts to attract higher-income populations and enhance the city's image may also lead to<br/> 
            changes and impacts on its cultural and historical heritage.<br/>
