           Newcastle being an old city, historical buildings are not easily demolished. We can see the history of Newcastle as a city from their functional transformation. As Sharon Zukin analyzed the formation and evolution of urban cultural landscapes in The Cultures of Cities. Functional transformations of historic buildings during Newcastle's urban transformation are not only a sign of the city's development, but also an important part of the city's cultural landscape. By reusing historic buildings and spaces, the city has created a new cultural landscape, attracted more cultural and creative industries to develop, and contributed to the city's economic prosperity.
Mapping can help show the spatial relationships and geographic locations of these changes. By labeling these locations with historical information and current uses, the evolutionary process and trajectory of the city can be presented. I used an ancient theme as the base map for this sidebar map to represent the historical development. I have chosen to use buildings from different time periods with different functions to tell the story of Newcastle's history, culture and significance as a city. I have also used images from different periods to compare and contrast to show the changes in function. The different geographical locations also show the reasons for the different functions of the buildings, such as the Chamber of Commerce and Customs being on the river and the factories being further away. As a whole, this is the transformation of Newcastle from a maritime commercial center to an industrial base to a city with a humanistic culture at its core.
Behind the transformation of the city we can see the shift to cultural industries after the exhaustion period of the old city's development, and the driving force behind the transformation of the city is precisely the social and cultural changes (Jane Jacobs). The theory of gentrification mentioned by Neil Smith in The New Urban Frontier: Gentrification and the Revanchist City makes it easy to see that the center of Newcastle today consists of a wide range of cultural venues and high end restaurants, behind which is the pressure of rising rents and increased costs of living, which attracts a large amount of population movement by changing the surrounding community landscape, with wealthy residents and businesses moving in and former residents moving out to a more urbanized area. Wealthy residents and businesses move in, and former residents move to more distant neighborhoods. The city's efforts to attract higher-income populations and enhance the city's image may also lead to changes and impacts on its cultural and historical heritage.
